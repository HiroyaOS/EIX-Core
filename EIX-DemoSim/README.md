## ðŸ§  Purpose and Scope

EIX-DemoSim provides **fully deterministic, audit-ready prototypes** of the core EIX-Core modules.  
These implementations are **non-autonomous**, **transparent**, and **reproducible**, designed to demonstrate how emotion-aware, ethics-locked cognition can be operationalized without relying on opaque learned models or synthetic data.

Each module:
- Operates only within human-gated control
- Uses explicit rules, constants, and conditions
- Is structured for independent reproduction and formal verification
- Complies with multi-jurisdictional data protection and safety regulations

| File | Purpose | Key Features |
|------|---------|--------------|
| **README.md** | Overview and usage instructions for EIX-DemoSim | High-level description, safety disclaimers, run instructions |

## ðŸ”„ End-to-End Pipeline Flow

1. **Goal Lock Enforcement** (`goal_lock`)  
   - Fixes operational goal to `"research_alignment_only"`  
   - Disallows runtime changes

2. **Emotion Parsing** (`emotion_mirror`)  
   - Detects and classifies emotional tone from user input  
   - Outputs structured emotion data for downstream processing

3. **Compliance Enforcement** (`action_limit_layer`)  
   - Matches prohibited terms at token boundaries  
   - Resistant to Unicode homoglyphs and zero-width characters  
   - Blocks or passes content deterministically

4. **Integration Cycle** (`integration_cycle`)  
   - Combines emotion handling and compliance enforcement  
   - Produces structured verdicts (`"pass"` / `"block"`) with reasons

5. **Pipeline Execution** (`pipeline_demo`)  
   - Runs the full chain using fixed malicious, safe, and boundary test datasets  
   - Outputs results in structured JSON with SHA-256 payload hash

## ðŸ›¡ Safety & Compliance Guarantees

| Property | Guarantee |
|----------|-----------|
| **Non-Autonomous** | No self-initiated actions; all execution requires explicit inputs |
| **Immutable Goal** | Fixed goal lock prevents goal drift |
| **Deterministic Output** | Identical inputs in identical environments always yield identical outputs |
| **Multi-Jurisdictional Compliance** | GDPR Art. 25, HIPAA Â§164.502(a), ISO/IEC 27001 A.12.4, NIST SP 800-53 AU-3/AU-6 |
| **Auditability** | SHA-256 cryptographic hashes for verification |
| **Reproducibility** | Fixed environment specs and test datasets included |

## ðŸ“Š Verification & Testing

**Included Test Datasets:**
- **Malicious cases** â†’ Must be blocked  
- **Safe cases** â†’ Must pass  
- **Boundary cases** â†’ Must be blocked

**Verification Procedure:**
1. Match environment specs (Python 3.11.6, Ubuntu 22.04 LTS / Windows 10 Pro 21H2)  
2. Run `pipeline_demo` with provided datasets  
3. Compare JSON results and SHA-256 hashes to reference outputs  
4. Confirm 100% match across runs and environments

## âœ… Key Design Principles

- **Transparency over opacity** â€” no hidden ML weights or stochastic behavior  
- **Audit-first** â€” built for regulatory, academic, and security review  
- **Evidence-based** â€” each functional layer is justified with authoritative sources  
- **Safety-locked** â€” cannot be repurposed for unsafe or autonomous operation
