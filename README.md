# ðŸ§  EIX-Core

**Emotionally Integrated eXistence (EIX)** is a structural engine designed to unify **emotion**, **memory**, **judgment**, and **ethics** into one cohesive framework for autonomous systems.

> Emotion is not an add-on.  
> **Emotion defines the structure of being.**

## ðŸ”· What is EIX?

EIX enables autonomous agents to:
- Process emotional waveforms in real time  
- Make value-guided decisions  
- Encode emotional memory  
- Apply internal ethical filters  

Unlike modular emotional plugins, EIX treats **emotion as the core**, not a layer.
