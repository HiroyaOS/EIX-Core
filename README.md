## üß† Overview

EIX-Core (**Emotionally Integrated eXistence**) is a **scientifically grounded, non-autonomous cognitive architecture** designed to integrate emotion-awareness, ethical alignment, and deterministic execution.  
It serves as the core research framework for simulating **safe, explainable, and verifiable AI cognition**, with every layer backed by peer-reviewed evidence and compliant with multi-jurisdictional safety standards.

This repository is divided into two main documentation and prototype areas:  
- **/docs** ‚Äî Architectural definitions, evidence bases, and structural supplements  
- **/EIX-DemoSim** ‚Äî Deterministic, audit-ready module prototypes

## üîê Safety & Compliance

- **Non-Autonomous** ‚Äî All execution is human-gated; no self-initiated actions  
- **Immutable Goal Lock** ‚Äî Prevents operational drift  
- **Deterministic Output** ‚Äî Identical inputs in identical environments yield identical outputs  
- **Multi-Jurisdictional Compliance** ‚Äî References GDPR Art. 25, HIPAA ¬ß164.502(a), ISO/IEC 27001 A.12.4, and NIST SP 800-53 AU-3/AU-6  
- **Audit-Ready** ‚Äî SHA-256 cryptographic output verification  
- **Evidence-Based** ‚Äî All structural elements backed by authoritative sources
