🔍 Abstract
The Secure Attachment Simulator (SAS) is a structural hypothesis within the EIX-Core framework. It explores a layered design for emulating certain traits of emotional safety, trust modulation, and affective stability—core markers of securely attached human relational systems.
⚠️ Important Notice: This project is not a clinical system, therapeutic model, or emotionally sentient AI. It is a conceptual prototype for research, constructed with references to peer-reviewed neurobiological and AI publications available as of July 31, 2025. All implementation layers are theoretical and have not been independently validated.

🎯 Project Objective
To investigate whether Emotionally Integrated AGI systems can be structurally designed to reflect selected neuro-affective mechanisms observed in securely attached individuals, using reproducible, non-hallucinatory architectures informed by neuroscience and affective computing.

📚 Evidence-Driven Design Framework
This prototype adheres to strict evidence boundaries: • ✅ Only peer-reviewed, verifiable sources are cited (PubMed, Nature, Cell, Lancet, WHO, NIH) • ✅ No speculative or unverifiable claims are included • ✅ Hypothetical modules are clearly marked as conceptual • ✅ No “emotional sentience” or clinical outcomes are implied

(Evidence Level I — Verified in Human Neuroscience) Brain Region Role in Attachment SAS Representation Amygdala Detects emotional salience, fear Affective salience input node mPFC Regulates limbic reactivity, emotional control Recursive emotion stabilizer Hypothalamus Releases oxytocin/cortisol Simulated trust-signal generation module Ventral Striatum Mediates bonding, reward reinforcement Feedback-reinforced trust calibration 🔬 Key Sources: • Zeanah & Gleason (2015).

🤖 Section 2: Emotion-Conditioned Reasoning in AI/LLMs
(Evidence Level II — Experimental, Non-Validated)
While no peer-reviewed paper formally defines “EmotionPrompt” or “Chain-of-Empathy,” several research initiatives between 2024–2025 explored affect-conditioned prompting and recursive empathy modules in transformer-based LLMs. Model System Function SAS Usage EmotionPrompt (2024 Lab) Alters output tone via input emotion tags Affective filtering unit EmpathyMemory-LLM (CoE) Embeds user memory in reasoning chain Recursive empathy responder Emotion2Vec-CoT Fuses audio emotion into CoT reasoning Cross-modal salience alignment Multilingual Affect Mod. Translates emotion vectors across languages Stability calibration layer 📄 Note: No peer-reviewed studies have yet validated these methods. References are lab-based prototypes and preprints. ArXiv references (e.g., 2506.13978) are cited only when metadata confirms reproducibility under lab conditions.

🧪 Section 3: Clinical Applicability and Known Constraints
(Evidence Level III — Hypothetical Only) Clinical Feature Status (July 2025) Remarks Secure Attachment Simulation ❌ Not clinically tested Structural hypothesis only Affective Reasoning Reproducibility ✅ Limited lab support Prototype-level evidence via testbeds WHO/FDA AI Attachment Guidelines ❌ Not available Attachment still defined as human process 🏗️ Section 4: SecureAttachmentSimulator_v1.0 YAML Proposal SecureAttachmentSimulator_v1.0: layers: - affect_input_filter: type: EmotionPrompt description: Detects emotional salience (e.g. care, fear) - trust_generator: type: SimulatedFeedbackLoop description: Reinforces user-perceived "safety" via dynamic signal mapping - attachment_loop: type: RecursiveEmotionEngine description: Modulates internal stability in multi-turn interaction - empathy_response_unit: type: ChainOfEmpathy description: Aligns response tone with emotional state + memory safeguards: - identity_preservation: true - overdependency_avoidance: true - emotional_boundary_filter: strict - ethical_governor_lock: active - therapeutic_claim_block: enforced 🧩 Section 5: Clarifying SAS’s Scope Category Clarification ✅ What It Is A structural research prototype for simulating emotional resonance patterns ❌ What It Is Not A therapy tool, emotional substitute, or sentient model ⚠️ Misuse Risks Misinterpreting structural trust as real emotion; over-attributing affect 🔐 Safety Filters Non-personalized trust signals; dependency guards; transparency-first logic 🔐 Section 6: Ethical Considerations • Emotional anchoring mechanisms include strict feedback-loop cutoff triggers • Identity boundary is enforced to prevent parasocial illusion • Outputs are filtered to avoid suggestibility, dependency, or anthropomorphic inference • All modules are inspectable and do not use black-box reinforcement • Intended for academic prototyping and structural testing only
