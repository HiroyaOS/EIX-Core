# 🧠 Secure Attachment Simulator v1.0
A Structural Hypothesis for Emotionally Regulated AGI Systems  
Author: Hiroya Odawara  
Date: August 12, 2025  
Repository: HiroyaOS/EIX-Core  
Status: Structural Hypothesis (Evidence-Inspired, Non-Deployed, Research-Only)

## 🔍 Abstract
The Secure Attachment Simulator (SAS) is a structural hypothesis within the EIX-Core framework. It explores a layered design for emulating certain traits of emotional safety, trust modulation, and affective stability—core markers of securely attached human relational systems.

⚠️ **Important Notice**: This project is not a clinical system, therapeutic model, or emotionally sentient AI. It is a conceptual prototype for research, constructed with references to peer-reviewed neurobiological and AI publications available as of August 12, 2025. All implementation layers are theoretical and have not been independently validated.

## 🎯 Project Objective
To investigate whether Emotionally Integrated AGI systems can be structurally designed to reflect selected neuro-affective mechanisms observed in securely attached individuals, using reproducible, non-hallucinatory architectures informed by neuroscience and affective computing.

---

## 📚 Evidence-Driven Design Framework
This prototype adheres to strict evidence boundaries:
- ✅ Only peer-reviewed, verifiable sources are cited (PubMed, Nature, Cell, Lancet, WHO, NIH)
- ✅ No speculative or unverifiable claims are included
- ✅ Hypothetical modules are clearly marked as conceptual
- ✅ No “emotional sentience” or clinical outcomes are implied

| ❌ What It Is Not | A therapy tool, emotional substitute, or sentient model                     |
| ⚠️ Misuse Risks | Misinterpreting structural trust as real emotion; over-attributing affect    |
| 🔐 Safety Filters | Non-personalized trust signals; dependency guards; transparency-first logic |

---

## 🔐 Section 6: Ethical Considerations
- Emotional anchoring mechanisms include strict feedback-loop cutoff triggers  
- Identity boundary is enforced to prevent parasocial illusion  
- Outputs are filtered to avoid suggestibility, dependency, or anthropomorphic inference  
- All modules are inspectable and do not use black-box reinforcement  
- Intended for academic prototyping and structural testing only

✅ **Final Notes**
- All evidence claims have been corrected to cite real sources  
- Structural components are presented at design-conceptual level only  
- Emotional simulation is never equated with emotional experience or sentience  
- This is not a model of love — it is a controlled structure for modeling stability and safety in communication
