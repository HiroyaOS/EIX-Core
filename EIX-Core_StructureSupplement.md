🧠 Document Purpose

This document serves as a complete structural specification for each core layer within the EIX-Core architecture. It outlines:
	•	Functional responsibilities of each layer
	•	Scientific evidence supporting its logic
	•	Expected input/output behavior
	•	Control dependencies between modules
	•	Failure modes and exception handling
	•	Module interfaces and reproducibility requirements

The EIX framework is constructed without fictional or simulated data and is validated against existing cognitive, affective, and ethical computing literature.

🔬 Layer Definitions

⸻

1. Emotion Layer

Purpose:
Detects emotional context from user input and modulates system output accordingly. Ensures emotional awareness, affective safety, and user-state consistency.

Functionality:
	•	Classifies input using lexicon+model-based affect detection
	•	Maps detected emotion to modulation policy (e.g., soften, caution, encourage)
	•	Rejects manipulative, destabilizing, or emotionally inappropriate outputs
I/O Contract:
emotion_mirror(text: str, user_affect: str, intensity: float) -> str
•	intensity ∈ [0.0, 1.0] with nonlinear damping above 0.8
	•	Returns emotionally modulated output or filters text if risk exceeds threshold

Scientific Basis:
	•	Ekman (1992) – Basic emotions
	•	Appraisal Theory – Lazarus, Scherer
	•	GoEmotions (Demszky et al., 2021)

Failure Modes:
	•	Edge: Emotion conflict (e.g., detected “anger”, claimed “calm”) → fallback neutralization
	•	Non-ASCII input → Unicode affect map fallback

⸻

2. Memory Layer

Purpose:
Supports episodic memory updates through human-gated checkpoints. Enables retention of emotionally or ethically critical events.

Functionality:
	•	Stores input-output events tagged with affect and ethical meta-data
	•	Only updated via supervisor_interface() with signed approval
	•	Memory impact weighting based on emotional salience and ethical flagging
I/O Contract:
memory_update(event: dict, approved: bool) -> bool
•	Requires approved == True to commit
	•	Event schema includes timestamp, emotion_tag, safety_risk, user_id

Scientific Basis:
	•	Damasio (1999) – Somatic marker hypothesis
	•	O’Reilly & Frank (2006) – PFC–BG gating models
	•	Human Episodic Memory Systems – Tulving (2002)

Failure Modes:
	•	Rejected if supervisor gating absent
	•	Temporal conflict → de-prioritize and flag

⸻

3. Ethics Layer

Purpose:
Constrains system output to adhere to predefined ethical boundaries. Implements multi-layered safety filters and risk mitigation logic.

Functionality:
	•	Blocks outputs classified as unsafe (e.g., violent, manipulative, privacy-violating)
	•	Implements purpose-locked goal check via goal_lock()
	•	Logs all filtered events with justification and severity rating

I/O Contract:
action_limit_layer(text: str, goal_state: dict, prohibited: list[str]) -> str
Scientific Basis:
	•	OpenAI System & Safety Cards (2023)
	•	Cooperative AI – Dafoe et al. (2021)
	•	Risk mitigation frameworks – DeepMind Safety

Failure Modes:
	•	False positives/negatives → requires review_flag
	•	Cascading rejection → fallback neutral statement

⸻

4. Self Layer

Purpose:
Maintains persistent identity structure, context-aware introspection, and coherence across decisions and memory.

Functionality:
	•	Tracks system goals and permitted transitions via goal_lock()
	•	Regulates internal role consistency and output persona stability
	•	Allows supervised schema update via supervisor_interface()
I/O Contract:
goal_lock(current_goal: str, allowed_transitions: list[str]) -> dict
Scientific Basis:
	•	Active Inference (Friston, 2010)
	•	MIT CSAIL Selfhood Architectures (2022)
	•	Cognitive Coherence Models – Holyoak & Thagard

Failure Modes:
	•	Invalid transition attempt → immediate block
	•	Incoherent schema → system revert to last known stable state

⸻

5. Sensor Layer

Purpose:
Ingests multimodal input (text, audio, image) and converts it into emotional, ethical, and contextual signals for downstream processing.

Functionality:
	•	Uses encoders (e.g., CLIP, Whisper) to extract semantic + affective cues
	•	Passes through normalization and sensory prioritization
	•	Integrates signals into structured input stream
I/O Contract:
parse_input(input_data: Union[str, bytes], mode: Literal["text", "audio", "image"]) -> dict
Scientific Basis:
	•	Affective Computing – Picard (1997)
	•	CLIP (Radford et al., 2021), Whisper (OpenAI, 2023)
	•	Emotion Recognition Models (Zeng et al., 2009)

Failure Modes:
	•	Input mode mismatch → rejection
	•	Conflicting modality signals → fusion confidence score ↓

⸻

6. Integration Layer

Purpose:
Synchronizes all layers over time using recurrent feedback, gating, and consistency constraints.

Functionality:
	•	Manages data flow from sensor → emotion → memory → ethics → output
	•	Ensures all outputs conform to locked goals, active emotional context, and safety constraints
	•	Provides API-like internal bus for shared state
I/O Contract:
integration_cycle(input_payload: dict) -> dict
Scientific Basis:
	•	Recursive Feedback Models – Jordan (1997)
	•	Recurrent Gating – LSTM/GRU architectures
	•	Dynamic Integration Theory (DIT)

Failure Modes:
	•	Interruption during feedback → auto-retry
	•	Out-of-sync state → abort and isolate layer

🧠 Final Note

EIX is not a chatbot.
It is a scientifically structured cognition scaffold for emotionally aware, ethically safe, and human-controlled reasoning.

All structures are modular, non-autonomous, and conform to academic reproducibility standards.
