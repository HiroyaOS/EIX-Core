## üß† Purpose and Scope

The `/docs` directory consolidates all **evidence-based, non-fictional, and fully referenced documentation** supporting the design and implementation of EIX-Core (Emotionally Integrated eXistence).  
It serves as the **primary reference hub** for researchers, auditors, and developers to understand the theoretical, empirical, and regulatory foundations behind each cognitive layer and integration protocol.

All documents in `/docs`:
- Are derived exclusively from verifiable, peer-reviewed, or authoritative sources
- Contain explicit source citations and regulatory references
- Are structured for independent verification and reproducibility
- Avoid speculative or fictional data entirely
