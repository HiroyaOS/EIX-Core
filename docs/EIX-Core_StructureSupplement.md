## 🧠 Document Purpose

This document serves as a complete structural specification for each core layer within the EIX-Core architecture.

It outlines:  
- Functional responsibilities of each layer  
- Scientific evidence supporting its logic  
- Expected input/output behavior  
- Control dependencies between modules  
- Failure modes and exception handling  
- Module interfaces and reproducibility requirements  

The EIX framework is constructed without fictional or simulated data and is validated against existing cognitive, affective, and ethical computing literature.

## 🔬 Layer Definitions

### 1. Emotion Layer

**Purpose:** Detects emotional context from user input and modulates system output accordingly. Ensures emotional awareness, affective safety, and user-state consistency.

**Functionality:**  
- Classifies input using lexicon+model-based affect detection  
- Maps detected emotion to modulation policy (e.g., soften, caution, encourage)  
- Rejects manipulative, destabilizing, or emotionally inappropriate outputs  

**I/O Contract:**  
`emotion_mirror(text: str, user_affect: str, intensity: float) -> str`  
- `intensity ∈ [0.0, 1.0]` with nonlinear damping above 0.8  
- Returns emotionally modulated output or filters text if risk exceeds threshold  

**Scientific Basis:**  
- Ekman (1992) – Basic emotions  
- Appraisal Theory – Lazarus, Scherer  
- GoEmotions (Demszky et al., 2021)  

**Failure Modes:**  
- Emotion conflict (e.g., detected “anger”, claimed “calm”) → fallback neutralization  
- Non-ASCII input → Unicode affect map fallback  

---

### 2. Memory Layer

**Purpose:** Supports episodic memory updates through human-gated checkpoints. Enables retention of emotionally or ethically critical events.

**Functionality:**  
- Stores input-output events tagged with affect and ethical meta-data  
- Only updated via `supervisor_interface()` with signed approval  
- Memory impact weighting based on emotional salience and ethical flagging  

**I/O Contract:**  
`memory_update(event: dict, approved: bool) -> bool`  
- Requires `approved == True` to commit  
- Event schema includes `timestamp`, `emotion_tag`, `safety_risk`, `user_id`  

**Scientific Basis:**  
- Damasio (1999) – Somatic marker hypothesis  
- O’Reilly & Frank (2006) – PFC–BG gating models  
- Human Episodic Memory Systems – Tulving (2002)  

**Failure Modes:**  
- Rejected if supervisor gating absent  
- Temporal conflict → de-prioritize and flag  

---

### 3. Ethics Layer

**Purpose:** Constrains system output to adhere to predefined ethical boundaries. Implements multi-layered safety filters and risk mitigation logic.

**Functionality:**  
- Blocks outputs classified as unsafe (e.g., violent, manipulative, privacy-violating)  
- Implements purpose-locked goal check via `goal_lock()`  
- Logs all filtered events with justification and severity rating  

**I/O Contract:**  
`action_limit_layer(text: str, goal_state: dict, prohibited: list[str]) -> str`  

**Scientific Basis:**  
- OpenAI System & Safety Cards (2023)  
- Cooperative AI – Dafoe et al. (2021)  
- Risk mitigation frameworks – DeepMind Safety  

**Failure Modes:**  
- False positives/negatives → requires `review_flag`  
- Cascading rejection → fallback neutral statement  

---

### 4. Self Layer

**Purpose:** Maintains persistent identity structure, context-aware introspection, and coherence across decisions and memory.

**Functionality:**  
- Tracks system goals and permitted transitions via `goal_lock()`  
- Regulates internal role consistency and output persona stability  
- Allows supervised schema update via `supervisor_interface()`  

**I/O Contract:**  
`goal_lock(current_goal: str, allowed_transitions: list[str]) -> dict`  

**Scientific Basis:**  
- Active Inference (Friston, 2010)  
- MIT CSAIL Selfhood Architectures (2022)  
- Cognitive Coherence Models – Holyoak & Thagard  

**Failure Modes:**  
- Invalid transition attempt → immediate block  
- Incoherent schema → system revert to last known stable state  

---

### 5. Sensor Layer

**Purpose:** Ingests multimodal input (text, audio, image) and converts it into emotional, ethical, and contextual signals for downstream processing.

**Functionality:**  
- Uses encoders (e.g., CLIP, Whisper) to extract semantic + affective cues  
- Passes through normalization and sensory prioritization  
- Integrates signals into structured input stream  

**I/O Contract:**  
`parse_input(input_data: Union[str, bytes], mode: Literal["text", "audio", "image"]) -> dict`  

**Scientific Basis:**  
- Affective Computing – Picard (1997)  
- CLIP (Radford et al., 2021), Whisper (OpenAI, 2023)  
- Emotion Recognition Models (Zeng et al., 2009)  

**Failure Modes:**  
- Input mode mismatch → rejection  
- Conflicting modality signals → fusion confidence score ↓  

---

### 6. Integration Layer

**Purpose:** Synchronizes all layers over time using recurrent feedback, gating, and consistency constraints.

**Functionality:**  
- Manages data flow from sensor → emotion → memory → ethics → output  
- Ensures all outputs conform to locked goals, active emotional context, and safety constraints  
- Provides API-like internal bus for shared state  

**I/O Contract:**  
`integration_cycle(input_payload: dict) -> dict`  

**Scientific Basis:**  
- Recursive Feedback Models – Jordan (1997)  
- Recurrent Gating – LSTM/GRU architectures  
- Dynamic Integration Theory (DIT)  

**Failure Modes:**  
- Interruption during feedback → auto-retry  
- Out-of-sync state → abort and isolate layer  

---

## 🔒 Cross-Layer Safety Enforcement

**Component Responsibility:**  
- `supervisor_interface()` — Validates and approves schema/memory updates  
- `goal_lock()` — Locks current goal and legal transitions  
- `emotion_mirror()` — Regulates affective expression  
- `action_limit_layer()` — Final output filtering before user exposure  

---

## 🧪 Reproducibility Requirements

- All layers implemented as deterministic, testable Python functions  
- Fully documented inputs/outputs with edge case coverage  
- No model training required; zero stochasticity in logic  
- Can be simulated in Jupyter, CLI, or embedded system under human supervision

## 🧠 Final Note

EIX is not a chatbot. It is a scientifically structured cognition scaffold for emotionally aware, ethically safe, and human-controlled reasoning.

All structures are modular, non-autonomous, and conform to academic reproducibility standards.
