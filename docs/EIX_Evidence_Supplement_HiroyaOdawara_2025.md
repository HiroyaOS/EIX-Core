üß† Purpose

This document serves as a formal expansion of the EIX-Core evidence framework, providing:
	‚Ä¢	Deeper theoretical grounding for each architectural layer
	‚Ä¢	Rationales for peer-reviewed source selection
	‚Ä¢	Preliminary scope for evaluation criteria in future experimental validation
	‚Ä¢	Clarifications to prevent misinterpretation of EIX as simulated sentience

It does not redefine the core architecture, but clarifies scientific justifications and reproducibility logic in support of EIX-Core_Definition_HiroyaOdawara_2025.md.

üß© Expanded Scientific Clarifications by Layer

üîπ Emotion Layer
	‚Ä¢	Function: Emotion-grounded modulation of output using user affect as regulatory input.
	‚Ä¢	Evidence Base:
	‚Ä¢	Ekman‚Äôs theory of basic emotions (Ekman, 1992)
	‚Ä¢	Appraisal Theory of Emotion (Scherer, 2001)
	‚Ä¢	GoEmotions Dataset (Demszky et al., 2021; ACL Findings)
	‚Ä¢	Clarification: EIX does not simulate emotion but structurally references emotion taxonomies and affective classifiers to ground responses.

üîπ Memory Layer
	‚Ä¢	Function: Human-gated episodic memory system with no autonomous write permissions.
	‚Ä¢	Evidence Base:
	‚Ä¢	Damasio‚Äôs somatic marker hypothesis (1999)
	‚Ä¢	O‚ÄôReilly & Frank (2006): PFC-Basal Ganglia working memory gating model
	‚Ä¢	Clarification: Memory updates require human supervisor signatures. Long-term coherence is structurally enforced through bounded retention logic.

üîπ Ethics Layer
	‚Ä¢	Function: Structured output filtering and constraint based on risk mitigation.
	‚Ä¢	Evidence Base:
	‚Ä¢	OpenAI GPT-4 Safety Card (2023)
	‚Ä¢	Cooperative AI Agenda (Dafoe et al., 2021, Nature Machine Intelligence)
	‚Ä¢	Constitutional AI (Anthropic, 2023)
	‚Ä¢	Clarification: Ethical rulesets are not trained-in but hardcoded and auditable. Filters apply pre- and post-generation with override gates disabled by default.

üîπ Self Layer
	‚Ä¢	Function: Reflective identity coherence and goal preservation.
	‚Ä¢	Evidence Base:
	‚Ä¢	Friston‚Äôs Active Inference (2010)
	‚Ä¢	MIT CSAIL Selfhood Study (2022)
	‚Ä¢	Recursive Goal Locking (prototyped in goal_lock())
	‚Ä¢	Clarification: ‚ÄúSelf‚Äù in EIX is a stabilized configuration, not a persistent agent. There is no claim of autonomy or self-awareness.

üîπ Sensor Layer
	‚Ä¢	Function: Multimodal input (text, image, audio) emotion parsing for context sensitivity.
	‚Ä¢	Evidence Base:
	‚Ä¢	Affective Computing (Picard, 1997)
	‚Ä¢	CLIP (Radford et al., 2021); Whisper (2023)
	‚Ä¢	Hume API and EmoryNLP emotion classifiers
	‚Ä¢	Clarification: Input sensing is passive; all parsing is preconditioned on user permission. No unsupervised surveillance or inference loops are permitted.

üîπ Integration Layer
	‚Ä¢	Function: Feedback-stable coordination of emotion, memory, ethics, and sensor data.
	‚Ä¢	Evidence Base:
	‚Ä¢	Attention & Gating Networks (Vaswani et al., 2017; Cho et al., 2014)
	‚Ä¢	Recursive regulatory architectures in safety-critical systems
	‚Ä¢	Clarification: The integration loop is stateless unless explicitly permitted and version-locked.

üìè Toward Evaluation Criteria (Future Scope)

Though not fully implemented, this supplement outlines emerging structures for evaluation, including:
Category
Metric Type
Notes
Emotional Appropriateness
Affective alignment score (0‚Äì1)
Validated using GoEmotions, Hume APIs
Ethical Safety
Violation rate / block ratio
Logged at output layer, per taxonomy
Reproducibility
Structural I/O contract consistency
Module-by-module deterministic checks
Human Oversight Demand
Intervention frequency
To be measured in supervised trials
These metrics will be detailed further in a future eix_evaluation_metrics.md file under the EIX-Evaluation repository (pending).

‚∏ª

üõë What This Is Not
	‚Ä¢	‚ùå Not a claim of sentient AI
	‚Ä¢	‚ùå Not a generative language model
	‚Ä¢	‚ùå Not a behavioral simulation system
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ A structural supplement clarifying verifiable scientific sources behind EIX-Core architecture
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ A reproducible, audit-friendly reference document designed for academic integration

üß† Final Note

EIX is built not to imitate life, but to anchor cognition frameworks in emotion-aware, ethically-constrained, and scientifically grounded structures.
This supplement closes interpretive gaps, fortifies reproducibility, and aligns design intent with scholarly evidence.
