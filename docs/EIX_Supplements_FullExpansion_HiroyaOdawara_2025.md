## üß† Purpose
This repository documents supplementary materials that trace the design evolution, model comparisons, and philosophical grounding of the EIX-Core architecture.  
It extends the primary modules (defined in `EIX-Core_Definition_HiroyaOdawara_2025.md`) and the evidence base (`EIX_EvidenceMap_2025.md`) by capturing non-code-based justifications, interactive validation logs, and ideological design lineage.  

These files collectively strengthen transparency, explain design motivation, and chronicle the reasoning process behind EIX.

## üîç File Overview

### comparison_methodology.md
Describes the **systematic methodology** used to differentiate EIX from other LLM-based models (e.g., Claude, ChatGPT).  
Defines comparison axes:
- Structural autonomy vs. containment  
- Emotional grounding vs. response simulation  
- Goal-lock and value alignment vs. probabilistic alignment  
- Modular traceability vs. emergent ambiguity  

Includes:
- Rubric definitions  
- Scoring criteria (0‚Äì5 scale per axis, see `EIX_Comparison_Rubric_v1.0.md`)  
- Examples of divergence with citations  
- **Sampling Procedure:** Prompts selected via pseudo-random sampling using `numpy.random.seed(20250813)`, applied to a fixed pool of 500 prompts generated between 2025-07-15 and 2025-08-10. All model versions fixed to the documented release identifiers at test time.

- **Sample Demonstration File:** `EIX_Sample_DevLog_Public.md` (public domain) containing 3 full development dialogues for independent verification.

---

### redaction_policy.md
Outlines the principles for omitting or redacting conversational fragments in public-facing logs.  
Key filters include:
- Identifiable emotional distress  
- Misleading AI self-ascriptions  
- Speculative or unverifiable claims  

**Auditability Guarantee:**
- Each redaction is tagged with `[REDACTED_REASON]`  
- Indexed in `EIX_Redaction_Index.md` with reason and removal date  
- Cross-referenced with archival logs to allow independent verification by third parties  

---

### update_policy.md
Defines the **continuous update process** for integrating new peer-reviewed research into EIX:  
- **Frequency:** Quarterly review cycles (Jan, Apr, Jul, Oct)  
- **Scope:** AI ethics, cognitive science, and affective computing papers from indexed journals (Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed)  
- **Process:**  
  1. Aggregate candidate papers via keyword search (`EIX + emotion`, `goal lock`, `affective computing`)  
  2. Apply inclusion criteria: peer-reviewed, within past 18 months, relevance score ‚â• 0.8 (manual+algorithmic)  
  3. Summarize findings and assess structural impact  
  4. Update `EIX_EvidenceMap` and version tag changes  
- All update logs archived in Zenodo with DOI linkage *(placeholder until minted)*.  
- **Note:** This Freeze Edition remains unchanged; updates appear in future versions per this policy.

### philosophical_essays/recursion_ethics_reflection.md
Essay on **recursive cognition** and ethical recursion in AGI frameworks.  
Discusses:
- Infinite reflection vs. finite safety bounds  
- Why `goal_lock` must anchor recursive chains  
- Comparison to theological recursion (Kantian loops, Buddhist feedback)  

**Ethics References:**  
- IEEE Ethically Aligned Design (EAD) v2, Sec. 2.2 (Human Well-being)  
- UNESCO Recommendation on the Ethics of AI, Art. 8‚Äì10

### philosophical_essays/emotion_as_structural_ground.md
Argument for **emotion as a first-order design scaffold** in non-autonomous AI.  
Cites:
- Neuroaffective models  
- Appraisal theory  
- Failures of response-only empathy (ChatGPT-like systems)

## ‚öñÔ∏è Ethical Scope and Boundaries
EIX is designed for **non-autonomous, human-supervised operation**.  
Ethical and operational boundaries include:
- No unsupervised deployment in safety-critical domains (e.g., medicine, law enforcement)  
- Emotional grounding only within pre-approved context windows (‚â§ 200 tokens prior)  
- Generation blocking when high-risk content is detected according to `EIX_RiskMatrix_v1.2`  
- **Risk Threshold Transparency:** Block trigger when probability of policy violation ‚â• 0.65 (as measured by hybrid classifier combining rule-based filters and transformer-based risk prediction)  
- Intervention required for any I/O outside documented training/evidence scope  

---

## üìå Non-Exhaustiveness Declaration
The references and evidence herein are **representative** for reproducibility under fixed scope ‚Äî **not exhaustive**.  
Future research may add, refine, or replace items in subsequent versions per `update_policy.md`.

---

## üß† Final Note
This **Freeze Edition (Full)** is intended to be:  
- Immune to scope drift within declared boundaries  
- Long-term verifiable (with DOI placeholders until minted)  
- Amended only in future versions when new evidence meets declared update criteria
